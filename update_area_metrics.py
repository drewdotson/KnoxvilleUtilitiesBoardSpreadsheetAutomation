# Since Pandas does not support advanced Excel formatting, Openpyxl will be used in another file to restore the formatting of this sheet.

# NOTE: This file contains every piece of functionality for specifically modifying the data present in the area sheet besides the time check functions 
#       as these functions are also used by the area metrics updating file.
