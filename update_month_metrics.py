# The purpose of this file is to update the month-by-month metrics analysis sheet. This sheet is modified based 
# off the installation job metrics that are pulled in from the main and archive sheets. The metrics are created 
# from scratch upon each iteration of this program.
# Since Pandas does not support advanced Excel formatting, Openpyxl will be used in another file to restore the 
# formatting of each sheet.
# NOTE: This file contains every piece of functionality for specifically modifying the data present in the area
#       sheet besides the time check functions as these functions are also used by the area metrics updating file.
