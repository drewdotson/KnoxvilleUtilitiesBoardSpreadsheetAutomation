# are pulled in from the main and archive sheets. The metrics are created from scratch upon each iteration of this program.

# Since Pandas does not support advanced Excel formatting, Openpyxl will be used in another file to restore the formatting of each sheet.

# NOTE: This file contains every piece of functionality for specifically modifying the data present in the area
#       sheet besides the time check functions as these functions are also used by the area metrics updating file.
