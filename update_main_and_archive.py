# The purpose of this file is to update the main installation job and 90 day archive sheets. Each sheet is edited based off
# of which rows in the main data sheet contain jobs that have been completed for at least 90 days. If a job meets the criteria,
# then the row containing the data is added to the archive sheet and then subsequentially removed from the main sheet.
# Since Pandas does not support advanced Excel formatting, Openpyxl will be used in another file to restore the formatting of
# each sheet.
# NOTE: Since this file is so short, every piece of functionality related to specifically updating the data in the main and 
#       archive sheets is stored in this file only.
