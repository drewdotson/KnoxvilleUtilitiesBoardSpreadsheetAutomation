
# The purpose of this file is to update the main installation job and 90 day archive sheets. Each sheet is edited based off of which rows in the main 
# data sheet contain jobs that have been completed for at least 90 days. If a job meets the criteria, then the row containing the data is added to the 
# archive sheet and then subsequentially removed from the main sheet.

# Since Pandas does not support advanced Excel formatting, Openpyxl will be used in another file to restore the formatting of both sheets.

# NOTE: Since this file is so short, every piece of functionality related to specifically updating the data in the main and archive sheets is stored 
#       in this file only.
